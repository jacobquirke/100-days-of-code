# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 4 October 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've worked through several exercises on W3Schools - HTML/CSS

**Thoughts** I've only just fully invested my time in coding and loving it so far. I've only scratched the surface but I want to get a strong foundation in HTML/CSS before I move onto anything else.

### Day 2: 5 October 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Made my first real dent into Javascript using freeCodeCamp's 'Basic Javascript' tutorials. Had a warm down later in the day by continuing practice on web layouts and navigation.

**Thoughts** Learning a completely new language is as hard as it sounds. There are moments where I think, 'I don't have a clue what this means or why I'm doing it,' but bit-by-bit I get a stronger grasp of things. Finally realising how important it is to be careful with my coding and to test and test.

### Day 3: 6 October 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with some Khan Academy (too childish and irritating) then moved onto freeCodeCamp for some in-depth Javascript work. I don't have a good grip on it but with perserverance I'll get there. I've been listening to the [Syntax podcast] (https://syntax.fm/) to get more familiar with language and gain valuable advice. Also, I ended the day once more by refining my knowledge of HTML/CSS which can be seen in the links to work.

**Thoughts** At the moment, it feels like when I played Dark Souls III for the first time. It was challenging and at anytime I can feel myself edging towards giving up. But something about web dev keeps bringing me back. It's addicted. And when you return to something and are albe to find a solution of look up a useful hint/cheat to help, it's rewarding. I just need to keep pushing.

### Day 4: 7 October 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Been pretty ill today. Did some Javascript tutorials but don't know how much sunk in. Just glad I'm continuing to push.

**Thoughts** Illness really takes your focus away but discipline kept me going to a certain degree.

### Day 5: 8 October 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Really struggling with JavaScript. I'm doing the tutorials but don't know how much I know. Just got to keep practicing and trying new things. I did a bit of extra work on learning new navigation styles in HTML/CSS - this time using JS!

**Thoughts** I need to remember what it was like learning all the different CSS for the first time. I'm still no expert in HTML/CSS but it's easier now. It it takes is practice and dedication.

### Day 6: 9 October 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: More work on JavaScript and data structures. Not inspired by in it the least. I think it's difficult when I can't see the tangeable use of it in the way it's being taught. It's more beneficial in learning when there's an emotional link to best remember everything.

**Thoughts** I think I need a break from JavaScript and focus more on web development and honing my skills in that regard. I want to focus on getting a job over learning things I can't see direct results from. Not sure if that's the right choice to make but I'm making it!

### Day 7: 10 October 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Working on React. Really complicated when you get into it. May have to return to JavaScript and Data Structures to feel more comfortable in dealing with the more complicated concepts. Just go at a simpler pace.

**Thoughts** I thought I needed a break when in fact I just need to keep pushing to have a good grounding in HTML/CSS and Javascript. I don't have to jump the gun. I need to have a good grasp of the fundaments. HTML/CSS, JavaScript and data structures. Spend the next month on those three. Get them DOWN!

### Day 8: 11 October 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Writing my first blog post on my experience thus far. A bit of work on data structures, JavaScript. Flitting about to see what I want to do this weekend.

**Thoughts** Feel at a en passe where I'm unsure how to progress. There's so much I can do. Probably best to become highly proficient in HTML/CSS, JavaScript and the DOM!

### Day 9: 12 October 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Starting a project to build my own Giphy gif generator using their API. First realy JavaScript project so let's see how it goes!

**Thoughts** Don't fully understand JavaScript or creating APIs but I'm learning. Just need to keep practicing and logging what I learn.

### Day 10: 13 October 2019: Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Working on further JavaScript principles including: the basics, data structures, object-orientated programming, algorithms (**struggling**) and functional programming. Also, I need to continue my gif search to see if I can get it does chain numerous searches on top of each other.

**Thoughts** Woke up and all I wanted to do was code. I'm feeling really good. I do need to make sure I keep brushing up on my HTML/CSS so I don't get rusty - Try CSS Grid today.

### Day 11: 14 October 2019: Monday

**Today's Progress** I have created a to do list by copying an example on W3Schools. There were bugs in my version which I fixed but unsure what I changed and how it affected it in the first place. I can replicate things but I don't think I can comfortable create anything untethered. I need to practice my basic HTML/CSS & JavaScript skills until it's second nature.

**Thoughts** JavaScript is challenging to get my head around so I need to go back to the start and get comfortable with it. The same with HTML/CSS. I want to be able to build things without having to think so when it comes to the more challenging work, I can really get stuck into it and have a good foundation.

### Day 12: 15 October 2019: Tuesday

**Today's Progress** My original plan was to focus on JavaScript. With the possibility of gaining my first web development client - a logistics company - I had some pressure put on myself to learn more about FTP/File Transfer Protocol (and SFTP/Secure File Transfer Protocol) in order to upload and manage a website. It has given me a clearer sense of what to do when wishing to create a site from scratch AND the interconnectivity between files i.e. using external stylesheets and scripts for better speed and cleaner code.

**Thoughts** I started the evening really worried that I wouldn't be able to get my task done in time but now I've gained more confidence than I expected. I feel very comfortable in creating an entire website now and linking everything together. Feeling very good about this - it feels as easy as it was when I was really in my stride at Spark44. Websites are just folders and files connected together in a seemingly fancy way. It's all very simple thinking about it.

### Day 13: 16 October 2019: Wednesday

**Today's Progress** I may have a possible client as mentioned yesterday. Learning plenty in the lead up to working with them. Need to have a strong sense of web development so practicing by building my own website and will attempt to access the CNT site through FileZilla. Time will tell. The pressure is really making me push to know the real-world applications of web development rather than the typical practising.

**Thoughts** Definitely had a feeling of dread today like I won't be able to build a landing page in the way that is suggested. All I have to do is learn everything I can and become the best web developer possible. I know what I can accomplish. I have taught myself so much and I know I can build websites. I just need to focus on what I'm doing and build my website.

### Day 14: 17 October 2019: Thursday

**Today's Progress** Continuing work on my website and officially gained my first client for web development - the logistics company. It's a big task and I still have lots to learn but I've got to get cracking now. No messing about - I have to prove to others and myself that I am officially a web developer.

**Thoughts** Definitely feel like I can't do it but this sense of dread os what really pushes me to do a lot of work. I can do it.

### Day 15: 18 October 2019: Friday

**Today's Progress** Started work on first official client as a web developer. Still have lots to learn but I'm doing it. Did some more practice on JavaScript.

**Thoughts** That imposter feeling is creeping in but I have the weekend to figure things out and become a better developer.

### Day 16: 19 October 2019: Saturday

**Today's Progress** Received another two certifications from freeCodeCamp. I feel like I'm cheating because I don't know what I'm doing entirely. I just need to keep trying and working hard and not try to cut corners. I've seen my first back-end work. Feels like learning JavaScript for the first time - I couldn't see how it could be useful as it's just the basic skills rather than using it in the real world so far. I will get there.

**Thoughts** I haven't got around to my client project today. I've been too excited by progressing to becoming a full stack developer. There's so much to learn but I need to remember to become a true expert in HTML/CSS and JavaScript (and Front-end libraries like Bootstrap, React, Angular & Vue). 

### Day 17: 20 October 2019: Sunday

**Today's Progress** Ridiculously productive day of building my website (rebuild) to fit the branding I want. I love it so far. Dip my toe into some PHP & Python (maybe SQL if there's time - probably not). I want to learn so much but know I need to focus on strengthening my front-end skills.

**Thoughts** It's been a great weekend. Really tough at points in learning npm and Node.js but it's like all things - a slow grind.

### Day 18: 21 October 2019: Monday

**Today's Progress** Focused learning of React. Need to get comfortable in the front end before I go crazy in other areas. I want to be a specialist in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React & Bootstrap. I can learn others from there. I should focus on these for now.

**Thoughts** It feels good to have a clearer focus. IT may not be the best in the job hunt but I know it's important that I focus my time in order to learn more effectively.

### Day 19: 22 October 2019: Tuesday

**Today's Progress** Solid work on React - Codeacademy is a much better system of tutorials so I might focus on that and do the projects on freecodecamp just for the certifications (only two to go I believe plus the Full Stack one as a plus). Listened to more Syntax but not everything makes sense at the moment - just need to get used to the terminology.

**Thoughts** It's very addictive to learn new things like this. It's challenging at times but, like Dark Souls, no matter how difficult it gets, I keep coming back for more punishment.

### Day 20: 23 October 2019: Wednesday

**Today's Progress** Completed codeacademy React.js Part I - onto Part II. Didn't do as much as I wanted to today but I have all day tomorrow to smash it!

**Thoughts** Doesn't feel like a normal day anymore without a good portion of it devoted to coding. It just makes sense to work on it even when it doesn't make sense. Deos that make sense?

### Day 21: 24 October 2019: Thursday

**Today's Progress** Slowly whittling down what I should really focus on - I need to be really strong in the front end before moving onto anything else fully. Master HTML, CSS & JavaScript through building projects. Tutorials only work so far. Worked on React which, in turn, made me wish to go back to basics.

**Thoughts** Don't feel confident in more complicated ideas - I need to focus on the projects I have and learning through them.

### Day 22: 25 October 2019: Friday

**Today's Progress** Started the day thinking I'd focus on the front end but had to force myself to learn php very quickly in order to complete my work for DNEL. I work very well when I know I have no choice but to complete a task. Really helps.

**Thoughts** It feels good to solve problems I had no idea I could. I've definitely learned a lot today and know I can push myself into more challenging situations.

### Day 23: 26 October 2019: Saturday

**Today's Progress** Completed the construction of the full page using my new understanding of php. Need to do some testing and modify the logo and parts to be better optimised for all platforms and devices.

**Thoughts** I am proud of the work I've done. Definitely can't wait to continue to build my portfolio and overall skills. Keep it up!

### Day 24: 27 October 2019: Sunday

**Today's Progress** Figured out how to incorporate PHP into my own site. A struggle but did it.

**Thoughts** Feel happy with what I've done today. Basic stuff in the grand scheme of things but I'm getting there towards full stack developer even when I thought I was going to focus on the front end.

### Day 25: 28 October 2019: Monday

**Today's Progress** Finally added the webpage to the DNEL website to only find that every contact form on the website is not working. Time for a larger project to begin!

**Thoughts** I don't think this will feel like a satisfying win until the contact forms are working. Annoying.

### Day 26: 29 October 2019: Tuesday

**Today's Progress** Working on my contact form and messing with my website. Didn't do as much work as I expected

**Thoughts** My website is definitely getting to a point where I can feel proud of it. I made it (with support and aid of templates).

### Day 27: 30 October 2019: Wednesday

**Today's Progress** Fiddling with my website again. Completed all the pages. Now it's to build it to a professional standard - make the transitions smooth and load time extremely good.

**Thoughts** The sooner I can get this up and running the better. My priority is to build up my portfolio now to flesh out my projects page. Let's 'av it!

### Day 28: 31 October 2019: Thursday

**Today's Progress** JavaScript practice.

**Thoughts** Not too much today. Enjoying holiday but still did some work.

### Day 29: 1 November 2019: Friday

**Today's Progress** JavaScript practice.

**Thoughts** Really need to feel more comfortable in using JavaScript.

### Day 30: 2 November 2019: Saturday

**Today's Progress** More JavaScript it's coming out my eyeballs but I really need to get a stronger grasp of it. I need to git gud.

**Thoughts** Definitely feel a coding fatigue but I know that I need to find projects to get involved in so I can feel that I can continue to achieve things.

### Day 31: 3 November 2019: Sunday

**Today's Progress** Genuinely believe I did nothing of value today.

**Thoughts** Not a good day in the slightest. It's a point between wanting and habit.

### Day 32: 4 November 2019: Monday

**Today's Progress** Decided on working towards a meditation app. I can create a desktop app but need to become more fluent in JavaScript.

**Thoughts** My aim is to create something, with ease, that I can feel proud of. I'm still checking in using templates but now I need to fully embracing building from scratch.

### Day 33: 5 November 2019: Tuesday

**Today's Progress** CSS work on the meditation app.

**Thoughts** Pretty standard. JavaScript is where it's going DOWN!

### Day 34: 6 November 2019: Wednesday

**Today's Progress** JavaScript time! The fun begins in building my meditation app. Lots to figure out and debug.

**Thoughts** I can definitely do JavaScript but need to grow in confidence. Got a job interview for Monday which is a real boost in confidence and helps to continue my drive to develop my skills.


### Day 35: 7 November 2019: Thursday

**Today's Progress** Debugging galore on my meditation app! Almost there

**Thoughts** Feeling fatigued by this project but I'll feel really good to know what I've accomplished.


### Day 36: 8 November 2019: Friday

**Today's Progress** Not too much today - working towards the big day on Monday. Want to make this all a career.

**Thoughts** Big weekend task is practicing JavaScript, data structures and then interview revision questions.


### Day 37: 9 November 2019: Saturday

**Today's Progress** Completed my meditation app. Could do with some more work on it but it's done for now. The rest of the weekend will be devoted on practicing JavaScript, data structures, algorithm and feeling more confident as a Front-end developer.

**Thoughts** Getting that imposter syndrome but I have to focus on knowing how passionate I am and knowing that I am willing to put the work in to pick things up (which I do very quickly).
