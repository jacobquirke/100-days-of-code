# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 4 October 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've worked through several exercises on W3Schools - HTML/CSS

**Thoughts** I've only just fully invested my time in coding and loving it so far. I've only scratched the surface but I want to get a strong foundation in HTML/CSS before I move onto anything else.

### Day 2: 5 October 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Made my first real dent into Javascript using freeCodeCamp's 'Basic Javascript' tutorials. Had a warm down later in the day by continuing practice on web layouts and navigation.

**Thoughts** Learning a completely new language is as hard as it sounds. There are moments where I think, 'I don't have a clue what this means or why I'm doing it,' but bit-by-bit I get a stronger grasp of things. Finally realising how important it is to be careful with my coding and to test and test.

### Day 3: 6 October 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with some Khan Academy (too childish and irritating) then moved onto freeCodeCamp for some in-depth Javascript work. I don't have a good grip on it but with perserverance I'll get there. I've been listening to the [Syntax podcast] (https://syntax.fm/) to get more familiar with language and gain valuable advice. Also, I ended the day once more by refining my knowledge of HTML/CSS which can be seen in the links to work.

**Thoughts** At the moment, it feels like when I played Dark Souls III for the first time. It was challenging and at anytime I can feel myself edging towards giving up. But something about web dev keeps bringing me back. It's addicted. And when you return to something and are albe to find a solution of look up a useful hint/cheat to help, it's rewarding. I just need to keep pushing.

### Day 4: 7 October 2019, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Been pretty ill today. Did some Javascript tutorials but don't know how much sunk in. Just glad I'm continuing to push.

**Thoughts** Illness really takes your focus away but discipline kept me going to a certain degree.

### Day 5: 8 October 2019, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Really struggling with JavaScript. I'm doing the tutorials but don't know how much I know. Just got to keep practicing and trying new things. I did a bit of extra work on learning new navigation styles in HTML/CSS - this time using JS!

**Thoughts** I need to remember what it was like learning all the different CSS for the first time. I'm still no expert in HTML/CSS but it's easier now. It it takes is practice and dedication.

### Day 6: 9 October 2019, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: More work on JavaScript and data structures. Not inspired by in it the least. I think it's difficult when I can't see the tangeable use of it in the way it's being taught. It's more beneficial in learning when there's an emotional link to best remember everything.

**Thoughts** I think I need a break from JavaScript and focus more on web development and honing my skills in that regard. I want to focus on getting a job over learning things I can't see direct results from. Not sure if that's the right choice to make but I'm making it!

### Day 7: 10 October 2019, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Working on React. Really complicated when you get into it. May have to return to JavaScript and Data Structures to feel more comfortable in dealing with the more complicated concepts. Just go at a simpler pace.

**Thoughts** I thought I needed a break when in fact I just need to keep pushing to have a good grounding in HTML/CSS and Javascript. I don't have to jump the gun. I need to have a good grasp of the fundaments. HTML/CSS, JavaScript and data structures. Spend the next month on those three. Get them DOWN!

### Day 8: 11 October 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Writing my first blog post on my experience thus far. A bit of work on data structures, JavaScript. Flitting about to see what I want to do this weekend.

**Thoughts** Feel at a en passe where I'm unsure how to progress. There's so much I can do. Probably best to become highly proficient in HTML/CSS, JavaScript and the DOM!
