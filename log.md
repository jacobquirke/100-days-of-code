# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 4 October 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've worked through several exercises on W3Schools - HTML/CSS

**Thoughts** I've only just fully invested my time in coding and loving it so far. I've only scratched the surface but I want to get a strong foundation in HTML/CSS before I move onto anything else.
