# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 4 October 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've worked through several exercises on W3Schools - HTML/CSS

**Thoughts** I've only just fully invested my time in coding and loving it so far. I've only scratched the surface but I want to get a strong foundation in HTML/CSS before I move onto anything else.

### Day 2: 5 October 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Made my first real dent into Javascript using freeCodeCamp's 'Basic Javascript' tutorials. Had a warm down later in the day by continuing practice on web layouts and navigation.

**Thoughts** Learning a completely new language is as hard as it sounds. There are moments where I think, 'I don't have a clue what this means or why I'm doing it,' but bit-by-bit I get a stronger grasp of things. Finally realising how important it is to be careful with my coding and to test and test.
