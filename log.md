# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 4 October 2019, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've worked through several exercises on W3Schools - HTML/CSS

**Thoughts** I've only just fully invested my time in coding and loving it so far. I've only scratched the surface but I want to get a strong foundation in HTML/CSS before I move onto anything else.

### Day 2: 5 October 2019, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Made my first real dent into Javascript using freeCodeCamp's 'Basic Javascript' tutorials. Had a warm down later in the day by continuing practice on web layouts and navigation.

**Thoughts** Learning a completely new language is as hard as it sounds. There are moments where I think, 'I don't have a clue what this means or why I'm doing it,' but bit-by-bit I get a stronger grasp of things. Finally realising how important it is to be careful with my coding and to test and test.

### Day 3: 6 October 2019, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued with some Khan Academy (too childish and irritating) then moved onto freeCodeCamp for some in-depth Javascript work. I don't have a good grip on it but with perserverance I'll get there. I've been listening to the [Syntax podcast] (https://syntax.fm/) to get more familiar with language and gain valuable advice. Also, I ended the day once more by refining my knowledge of HTML/CSS which can be seen in the links to work.

**Thoughts** At the moment, it feels like when I played Dark Souls III for the first time. It was challenging and at anytime I can feel myself edging towards giving up. But something about web dev keeps bringing me back. It's addicted. And when you return to something and are albe to find a solution of look up a useful hint/cheat to help, it's rewarding. I just need to keep pushing.
